My name is Milon, you can call me whatever you like, I don't mind it.\
I know a bunch of stuff about some things, mostly C# .NET, system management, some UI/UX dev, full-stack.\
Not active that much here becasue well, work and life and such!\
Living embodiment of chaos.

> Low effort and catastrophic is just my aesthetic.
